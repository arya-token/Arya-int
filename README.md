# ARYA: INTERNATIONAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS


//Abstract: Arya is a movement seeking solutions to health problems at the international level through blockchain. It aims to be the 3rd party that people will trust by creating health solutions and an economy with the token economy.

//Introduction
The health issue has always been a question mark around the world. Although there is no equal access to resources, this is a difficult issue even for those in the best situations. Today, the results due to covid-19 are the best indicator of this. The attitude of states towards their citizens has raised questions. It seems that organizations like the WHO are nothing more than bureaucracy. States that think that scientific data sharing carries various risks - which is a fact that it has a fair share - are closed on this issue. Another consequence of the disease will be its psychological angle. People who leave society will have the possibility of being dismissive and insensitive to death news. Issues such as the rise of nationalism (care racism) and famine are things that occur during every pandemic process. Smart contracts coined the concept of a reliable third party. In an environment where smart contract conditions are established, it will allow agreement between matches without the need for another person. We can think of this across states. The gene map that could cause any biological attack may not be shared. However, this situation can be provided as encrypted.


//Goals
Arya aims at the security of users by providing ease of sharing scientific data and encrypting data using blockchain. It also aims to select the parts to be encrypted through network voting and network voting in the selection of the people who will do the work. It also aims to further anonymize usage by developing IoT devices.

//Ready Project
Hla Matcher, this project aims to open a worldwide bone marrow transplant channel. Users will enter their data and wait for the best match. When the contract is completed, it creates a communication channel. Arya promises tokens and similar rewards to the person who donates marrow. Healthcare organizations that participate at the institutional level also receive token support.
//R&D
